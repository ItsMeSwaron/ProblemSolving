Nowadays, a lot of individuals use their home computer for regular everyday tasks including work, school, shopping, seeing the doctor, and leisure. As the amount of time spent online has increased, so too has cybercrime. Cybercrime targets people, small and large organizations, academic institutions on society. cybercrime was seen as a significant worldwide threat. People have been using the Internet for employment, education, shopping, healthcare, entertainment, and government activities on a regular basis since the pandemic. As a result, there has been a 60% increase in Internet traffic reported by certain fixed and mobile holders, indicating a global surge in demand for broadband communications services. Since the pandemic, telemedicine has increased at an extraordinary rate in all professions, but notably in psychiatry. Telemedicine is a good fit for psychiatry because most services don't need face-to-face communication. Virtual visits are currently a common way for many outpatients to get psychiatric care, and most people say that telepsychiatry will continue to improve and grow in the future. During the pandemic, many people are choosing not to receive medical care. In the USA, about half of the adult population has put off getting medical care because they fear that they will the virus in medical facilities like hospitals, clinics. There is no reason to believe that once the pandemic is over, cybercrime will go down. Conventional physical theft crimes, such as breaking into a home or place of business, leave a lot of evidence, such as security camera footage, DNA, fingerprints, and shoeprints. On the other hand, a cybercriminal conceals their identity and faces minimal chances of being caught or jailed. Cybercrime comes in a variety of forms, such as denial of service attacks, malware, phishing, extortion, and work-from-home schemes. The COVID-19 problem was a tool that thieves used to accomplish their objective. For example, they engaged in phishing using emails and WhatsApp messages pretending to represent the WHO and containing COVID-19 updates. There is worry that people are becoming easy targets for cybercriminals due to their lack of experience, unfamiliar tools, and inexperience with technology, which makes them vulnerable to cyber attack. The rise in cybercrime in the UK during the pandemic primarily affected people as opposed to businesses.People who commit cybercrime frequently take an active part in the illegal process that results in them becoming the victim, such as answering a phishing email and revealing personal information. People could not be alert enough to spot fake processes or signals, or they might not be cautious enough to recognize them. Online fraud victims may experience both financial and psychological consequences. Significant, sudden drops in wealth are linked to mental health issues, particularly depression, as was the case in the USA and Europe following the financial crisis of 2008. Online fraud victims testify that the psychological fallout from being deceived is just as real as the money costs.A mental disorder may make a person more vulnerable to cybercrime. Individuals who are mentally weak, such as those suffering from serious mental illnesses and senior citizens, are vulnerable to many forms of financial fraud. When a patient is provided medication, the pharmacist prints instructions, warnings, and possible side effects for them, and the doctor gives them instructions. In the same way, patients should be informed that using the internet for anything—including mental health services—carries a significant risk of cybercrime. It is recommended that psychiatrists who use or suggest technology give patients access to a list of reliable resources that teach consumers how to identify and reduce the danger of cybercrime. Patients with mental illnesses may be more vulnerable to cybercrime, but they may also be less aware of the risks involved, dangerous internet habits, and risk-reduction strategies. Psychiatrists need to start by offering a suggested list of reliable resources that inform patients about cybersecurity.","output":""}],"interactive":false,"memoryLimit":1024,"timeLimit":3000,"srcPath":"e:\\PHITRON\\Semester 1\\C++ for DSA & Basic Data Structures\\word Counter.cpp","group":"local","local":true}
